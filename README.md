# node-crud-app

A CRUD application that is written in Node JS with the use of Express and Mongoose

The project was initially made to practice CRUD on Node JS and how it works.

> Took quite awhile lol

## Commands

Open a terminal and type in `npm install` to download all what was added as a dependency

When done installing, put in `npm run start` in order for your `localhost:5000/students` to run (currently set on 5000 and the middleware dictates the route to be `/students`).
